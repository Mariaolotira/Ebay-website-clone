<h1 align="center">  Ebay E-Commerce Website </h1>

eBay is one of the oldest and most successful e-commerce websites on the Internet, but it doesn’t sell any items itself. Instead, it allows users to list items for sale, which other users can then bid on in auctions. Recently, eBay has also added options to buy items at face value, or submit price offers for them. The clone created by Zetech students indicated below as a Web Development 1 project. The website contains the items indicated below. The website is incomplete but an interface can be seen with a certain direction and workflow(Not everything is implemented). The search optimization was used using local db where the query will look for the names of the items searched from the names of products in the site. Enjoy the presentation.
